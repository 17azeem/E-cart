Product Name: Acroball by Pilot

Details: The Acroball by Pilot is a ballpoint pen made of 77% recycled plastic. It uses a special low-viscosity ballpoint ink that combines the smoothness and reliability of a ballpoint pen with the crisp, vibrant lines of a gel pen. The Acroball comes in a full range of ink colors.

Uses: Recycled plastic pens can be used just like traditional plastic pens for writing and note-taking.

Replacement: Recycled plastic pens are replacing traditional plastic pens, which are made of non-renewable resources and contribute to plastic waste. Recycled plastic pens, on the other hand, are made of post-consumer recycled materials, reducing waste and conserving resources.
