Product Name: Bamboo Straws by Jungle Straws

Details: These straws are made from mature bamboo stalks that are harvested from plantations and forests in Vietnam. They are steam cleaned and pressure washed without the use of any harmful pesticides or chemicals.

Uses: Bamboo straws can be used time and time again for any drink. They are great for keeping drinks at their original temperature and are safe to use with both hot and cold beverages.

Replacement: Bamboo straws are replacing traditional plastic straws, which are not biodegradable and can take hundreds of years to decompose. Bamboo straws, on the other hand, are 100% biodegradable and can be composted at the end of their life. They are a more sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic straws.
